## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year Software Engineering student from Universiti Malaya. Throughout my education I have participated in a few Hackathons such as 'VHack USM' and 'Hack2Hire'. I have six months of industrial training with PETRONAS Digital. I a
m currenlty working on my final year project titled "UMakan", which is a mobile app that helps students manage their financial and nutritinal diet at the same time.

I am currently learning Software Maintanence and Evolution at Universiti Malaya. I am excited to learn about fixing bugs, adapting to new environments, and enhancing performance or features to keep software running efficiently as well as improving and expanding a system to meet changing user needs while managing technical debt and ensuring long-term sustainability.

Fun fact, I am a stage and screen actor on the side when I am not doing University-related activities.
